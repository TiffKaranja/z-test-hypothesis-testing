Question 1: Z-Test for Known Population Std Dev
Q1: A manufacturer claims that the average length of its metal rods is 50 cm. A quality control analyst selects a random sample of 40 rods and finds the sample mean to be 48.7 cm. The population standard deviation is known to be 2.5 cm.
Use a two-tailed Z-test at the 0.05 significance level to test whether the average rod length is significantly different from 50 cm.
Python Task:
Calculate the Z-score.


Find the p-value.


Conclude whether to reject the null hypothesis.



Question 2: Hypothesis Test on Exam Scores
Q2: A teacher claims that the average exam score in her class is 75. A student believes it's different. She collects a random sample of 30 exam scores and finds the mean to be 72. The population standard deviation is known to be 8.
Perform a two-tailed Z-test at α = 0.01 to check if the mean is significantly different from 75.
Python Inputs:
μ = 75


x̄ = 72


σ = 8


n = 30


α = 0.01



Question 3: Customer Spending Analysis
Q3: A store claims that their average customer spends $200. A data analyst thinks this has changed. She collects data from 50 customers and finds an average of $190, with a known population standard deviation of $25.
Test the claim using a two-tailed Z-test at the 5% significance level.

Question 4: Package Weight Validation
